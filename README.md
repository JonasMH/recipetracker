# Recipe Tracker

A small hobby project for tracking the food recipes I use here at home, and improve on them over time.

> Note: still in its early stage

Features:

- Git based storage/database (If you call that a feature)
- Full history of changes (Thanks Git)

## Developing

For Linux:

1. Have `devbox` and `direnv` installed
1. cd into the repo
1. `direnv allow`
1. `make restore`
1. `make watch`

   > The application should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`
